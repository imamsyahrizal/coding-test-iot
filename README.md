## Task 3 - Sensor Aggregation Simulation
Web based application made by Streamline Python.  
### Library used in this project : 
1. The Streamlit v1.11.0 library was used to generate the dashboard.
2. Numpy to generate a random value
3. Pandas to process the data frame
4. Time to pause
5. Plotly.express to make a live graph
6. Datetime to get the current time
